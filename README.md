# Kickstarter_Analysis_Challenge

## Overview of Project

Our client, Louise, would like to understand more details on Kickstarter campaigns and would like to leverage our prior analysis on Kickstarter campaigns and gain insight for her play campaign.  The goal of this project is to examine theater Kickstarter campaigns and their launch dates to determine if there is a preference better time to launch a successful campaign.  In addition, an examination of the outcomes relative to goals will be analyzed as well.  

### Purpose
  The purpose of the project is to build off existing work for the client.  The focus of this analysis is to examine the Kickstarter dataset for theater campaigns.  The focus will be to determine trends or relationships on the success of failure of a theater campaign based on the timing of its launch and/or fundraising goals.  Understanding when is the best time to launch a successful campaign and setting a goal expectation to lead to the highest chance of a successful outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date

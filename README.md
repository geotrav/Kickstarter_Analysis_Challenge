# Kickstarter_Analysis_Challenge

## Overview of Project

Our client Louise would like to understand more about prior analysis on Kickstarter campaigns and gain insight for her play campaign.  The goal of this project is to examine theater Kickstarter campaign launch dates and determine if there are better time to launch a successful campaign.  In addition, an examination of the outcomes relative to goals will be analyzed as well.
